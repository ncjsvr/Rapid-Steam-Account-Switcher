# Rapid-Steam-Account-Switcher
Quickly switch between Steam accounts without needing a Steam Guard code every time

I’ve been looking for a way to switch between 3 different steam accounts I own (it’s not needed to have more than one, but many of us do). There are various programs on the web that will help you do this, but my problem is I don’t trust any of them.

Here is a bat script which you can customize which can help you achieve this. As it’s all local and edited by you on your machine you know exactly what it is doing. The best part is once you have used it to log in to each account once, you’ll never have to enter a steam guard code again when opening steam!

What you need to do now is customize this to your usernames, replace all SteamUsername1, SteamUsername2 etc with your steam username. 

This bypasses Steam Guard once you have entered a Steam Guard code once per account whilst using this script.

<h1>Usage</h1>
Download SteamSwitchAccount.bat and customize using your favourite editor.
Replace all SteamUsername1, SteamUsername2 etc with your steam username. 
Note: The usernames need to match, so there are 2 x SteamUsername, make sure it's set to the same thing.
